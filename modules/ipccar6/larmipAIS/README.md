# ipccar6/larmipicesheet

This module directly samples from output of the Levermann et al. (2020) LARMIP-2 emulator of AIS dynamic contributions, augmented by an AR5-style calculation of Antarctic surface mass balance.

(Note that the emulator is run offline; see the larmip/icesheet module for an online version.)
