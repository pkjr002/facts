dV_regional_xxx_txt:
- xxx is the forcing data set (either "cru" or a CMIP5 model run)
- first column is year
- columns 2-20 are regional sums of annual glacier mass loss in mm SLE, regions ordered as in table 1
- columns 21-39 are one standard error of columns 2-20, in mm SLE

dV_regional_accum_xxx_txt:
- xxx is the forcing data set (either "cru" or a CMIP5 model run)
- first column is year
- columns 2-20 are regional, temporally accumulated annual sums of glacier mass loss in mm SLE, regions ordered as in table 1
- columns 21-39 are one standard error of columns 2-20, in mm SLE

dV_global_xxx_txt:
- xxx is the forcing data set (either "cru" or a CMIP5 model run)
- first column is year
- column 2 is the global sum of annual glacier mass loss in mm SLE
- column 3 is one standard error of column 2, in mm SLE

dV_global_accum_xxx_txt:
- xxx is the forcing data set (either "cru" or a CMIP5 model run)
- first column is year
- column 2 is the global, temporally accumulated annual sum of glacier mass loss in mm SLE
- column 3 is one standard error of column 2, in mm SLE

In the CMIP5-forced datasets, the forcing up until 2005 is from the corresponding "historical" CMIP5-runs.
