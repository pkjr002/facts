1955 - 1956 VALUES BASED ON READINGS OF HIGH AND LOW WATERS
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-JUN-91 :
Veraval             500/021 RLR(1962) is 11.9m below GTS SBM 1955
=========================== BENCHMARK INFORMATION UPDATE ADDED  12-JUL-93 :
Veraval             500/021 RLR(1962) is 11.9m below GTS SBM 1955
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 04-AUG-94 :
For a discussion of interannual variability of sea level along the coasts of Pakistan and India, see Clarke and Liu, Journal of Physical Oceanography, 24, 1224, 1994.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Feb06 :
Veraval replaced by nearest port Porbandar in Feb. 1997, but was ravaged by cyclone in June 1998 and not yet reconstructed.  Unsure when Veraval ceased operating.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2002Dec06 :
SMRC Newsletter Jul-Dec 2001 reports high E coast correlation with SOI and MSL. MSL is much higher during La Nina tropical cyclones than during El Nino.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 26-Jan-2016 :   
A value of MTL-MSL=19 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1955-1956.  This value was derived by Philip Woodworth in preparation of his MTL/MSL manuscript.  In this case the value was derived using a historic databank of harmonic tidal constants gathered by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).  Care must be taken when using these IHO constants, though, as there are many known errors in tidal amplitudes and phases.
