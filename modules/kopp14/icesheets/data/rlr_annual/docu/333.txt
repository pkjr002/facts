1929-1930 GAUGE SITED AT 22 17 N 114 13 E
1949 GAUGE INSTALLED AT ARSENAL YARD ON 26TH OCTOBER
1952 GAUGE TRANSFERRED TO NORTH POINT ON 23RD OCTOBER
REPLACED BY QUARRY BAY (611/010) AFTER 1985
=========================== BENCHMARK INFORMATION UPDATE ADDED  12-JUL-93 :
North Point, HK     611/011 RLR(1975) is 11.2m below Rifleman's Bolt
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Dec03 :
According to Dr.Baki Iz (Hong Kong Polytechnic University)
reference benchmarks at the North Point and Quarry Bay gauges show
from episodic levelling significant settlement with respect
to neighbouring marks (October 1998). However, data provided for these
sites are conventionally referred to the more stable Principal Datum
and Rifleman's Bolt benchmark by means of frequent levelling.
Note that the North Point and Quarry Bay datums are the same and
their RLR time series may be combined to make one continuous record
if wished with reasonable confidence.
