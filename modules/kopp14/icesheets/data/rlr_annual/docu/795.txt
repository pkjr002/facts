When the above comment was entered the only way to flag any particular point was to flag the whole year. This no longer applies with the new database. The flagging has been edited so that December 1961 is the only point flagged. Data for 1963-64 has also been reviewed and datapoints now flagged are just February-June 1964. Ensenada is an historic station last data 1990
