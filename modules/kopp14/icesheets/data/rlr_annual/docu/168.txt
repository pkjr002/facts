=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 14-JUL-94 :
For a discussion of submergence near to Venice see Emery and Aubrey (Sea Levels, Land Levels and Tide Gauges), 1991, Springer-Verlag, page 34.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Nov24 :
Punta della Salute  270/054 RLR(1919,Stefano) is 6.893 m below 'IGM1897'
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 1999Nov24 :
RLR values for Venice San Stefano (270/051) and Punta della Salute (270/054) should be to essentially the same datum enabling one composite record to be made.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Mar24 :
Data for 1909-1939 are Mean Tide Level which at Venice should be within 4 mm of Mean Sea Level. Data were obtained via Paolo Pirazzoli March 2000.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 2000Mar27 :
The secular trend in MSL at venice during the twentieth century was a factor or two greater than at Trieste, which is almost certainly related to local anthropogenic effects including ground water pumping, see for example several publications by P.A.Pirazzoli.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 26-Jan-2016 :
A value of MTL-MSL=0 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1909-1939.  This is in agreement with the 2000Mar24 comment.  Philip Woodworth obtained values of -1 mm and 4 mm from two records in the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset preparation of his MTL/MSL manuscript.
Venezia (Punta Della Salute) is an historic station last data 2000
