# fair/temperature

This module wraps around the FAIR climate model emulator. It generates samples of global mean surface air temperature and ocean heat content under prescribed emissions trajectories.

This is a rewrite of ar6_rff_climate_ensemble.ipynb. The code within the facts was adapted by greg and belongs to kelly from CIL who is the developer of this module
