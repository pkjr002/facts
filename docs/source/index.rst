`The Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) <https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts>`_
is an open-source modular, scalable, and extensive framework for global mean,
regional, and extreme sea level projection that is designed to support the
characterization of ambiguity in sea-level projections. It is designed so users
can easily explore deep uncertainty by investigating the implications on GMSL,
RSL, and ESL of different choices for different processes. Its modularity allows
components to be represented by either simple or complex model. Because it is
built upon the Radical-PILOT computing stack, different modules can be
dispatched for execution on resources appropriate to their computational
complexity.

FACTS is being developed by the `Earth System Science & Policy Lab <http://www.earthscipol.net/>`_ and the
