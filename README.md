# Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) 

We are still catching up on things since our work with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6). This involves cleaning up lots of framework and module code. Your patience during this process is greatly appreciated!

See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6419954 for the FACTS modules, data sets, and scripts used to produce the AR6 sea level projections.

See https://github.com/rutgers-ESSP/ipCC-AR6-Sea-Level-Projections for a guide for accessing the IPCC AR6 sea level projections data.
