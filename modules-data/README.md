Due to their size, the data files supporting the FACTS modules are not stored in the code base.

As of December 2022, the data for stable FACTS modules are available on Zenodo at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478191 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7478447
(note, split between two Zenodo entries because of size limitations). 

These can be downloaded using wget:

```
wget -i modules-data.urls.txt
```
